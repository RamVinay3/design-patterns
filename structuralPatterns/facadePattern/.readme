The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified, unified interface to a complex subsystem or group of classes.

It acts as a single entry point for clients to interact with the system, hiding the underlying complexity and making the system easier to use.


If we see the example we have taken,client is clicking on book movie ticket, then in the backend
The facade is taking care of all the services like payment , reserving seat, sending notification ,
generating ticket and loyality addPoints
we cannot give all of these options separately to the user , so we create a facade to all of them under one service call.


-----we need to use interface for better coding in future ,just to understand we call classes over there--------
