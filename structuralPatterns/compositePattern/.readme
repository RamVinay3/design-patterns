The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.


leaf - Product ,composite - bundles or combinations of those products in single entity

we want to treat composite and individual objects as single object , please do carefully whether we want to consider composite and single as same or not.

Eg:Cart of amazon or flipkart
