instead of accessing real object directly we will extend the real class with another class(proxy) and we will apply
the either caching ,filtering,logging etc., or any thing we want to do.


The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

A proxy acts as an intermediary that implements the same interface as the original object, allowing it to intercept and manage requests to the real object.
