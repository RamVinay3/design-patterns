The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that addresses problems related to object creation mechanisms. It is especially useful when constructing complex objects step-by-step with various optional components.

Why Use the Builder Pattern?
.Often in software systems, especially when building configurations or composite objects, the number of constructor arguments can get out of hand. Builder Pattern provides:

.Clarity in object creation
.Step-by-step construction
.Immutability of the final object
.Better readability and maintainability

-------the need came due to lack of optional parameters in java--------

The Builder Pattern allows you to construct a complex object (like BurgerMeal) in multiple steps, such as:


BurgerMeal meal = new BurgerMeal.Builder()
    .setBun("Italian")
    .setPatty("Veg")
    .addFries(true)
    .addColdDrink(true)
    .build();
