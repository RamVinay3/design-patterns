1. we will develop interfaces and it's respective classes for different things and we will implement it . -product
2.we will have a factory interface which will define all methods to define for object creation.- factory for product
3. now we will create a service which will define all those normal(product) interfaces as attributes and we will pass factoroy as 
    parameter in constructor so that it will intialize all the variables.
 we will define one method which has only bussiness logic -that's all.
