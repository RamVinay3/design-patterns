The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern used to clone existing objects instead of constructing them from scratch. It enables efficient object creation, especially when the initialization process is complex or costly.   



Here first we create one object during compilation of class and store it in maps ,whenever we require
anothe instance we will just return the clone of the object and make the modifications so that other won't be affected.

that is why we have setter method for content in constructor we have default .

if object is complex ,don't follow prototype .because deep cloning will be difficult and it might introduce bugs
