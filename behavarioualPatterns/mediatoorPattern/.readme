The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

Instead, they communicate through a mediator object, which encapsulates how these objects interact.
Real-Life Analogy
Think of an air traffic controller at an airport:
Pilots of different planes donâ€™t talk to each other directly.
Instead, each pilot communicates with the air traffic controller (mediator), who coordinates all landing, takeoff, and navigation to avoid collisions.
This centralized communication keeps operations safe and organized.

The air traffic controller acts as the mediator, managing the interaction between multiple independent aircraft.
Problem It Solves
It solves the problem of tightly coupled communication between components. For example, consider:
A chat application where users send messages to each other in a group.
A GUI form where multiple components (like buttons, sliders, and inputs) need to coordinate their behavior.
Collaborative systems like project management tools with interconnected modules.

Instead of having each component manage its dependencies, the Mediator Pattern lets you delegate interaction logic to a central mediator that handles coordination in a cleaner and more manageable way.
