The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables you to save and restore the previous state of an object without exposing its internal details.

It’s particularly useful when implementing features like undo/redo functionality or restoring a snapshot of an object’s state.

Real-Life Analogy
Think of playing a video game:
You can save your progress at a specific point in time.
If something goes wrong (like your character dies), you can load the saved game and continue from that point.
You don’t need to know the exact game internals — just press "Save" or "Load."

The saved game is a memento, the game engine is the originator, and the game menu is the caretaker managing the saved states.
