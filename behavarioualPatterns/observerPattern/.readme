The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a dependency between objects, where a change in one object (the subject) results in automatic updates to all dependent objects (observers).

It promotes a loose coupling between the subject and its observers, improving flexibility and reusability.

-------------------
1.create interfaces for both subscribers(listeners) and Channel(Subject - central object)
2.implement those concrete classes .
