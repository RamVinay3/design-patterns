The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object change its behavior when its internal state changes.

It encapsulates state-specific logic into separate classes and delegates behavior to the current state, improving flexibility and maintainability.
-----------when to use it--------

1.whenever object behaviour depends upon it's internal state
2.state transitions are well-defined and finite.
3.you want to avoid complex if-else or switch statements
4.state transitions should be explicit
5.you want each state to have it's own rules and behaviour

------------it's very near to command pattern - but we don't pass context over there 
in a page , the state should change depending upon next step eg. swiggy order.
