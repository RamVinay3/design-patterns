The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you add further operations to objects without modifying them.

It separates an algorithm from the object structure it operates on, enabling operations to be added by external visitor classes.

Real-Life Analogy
Think of a tax auditor visiting different departments in a company:
Each department (HR, Finance, IT) is a different object with its own data and structure.
The auditor (visitor) applies specific operations or checks for each department.
The departments don’t need to know the auditor’s logic—they just "accept" the visit.

The auditor performs different actions depending on the department visited, but the department itself doesn’t need to change.
